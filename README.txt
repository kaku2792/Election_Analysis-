Electin Audit Summary:
This script can be used for any election because it specifically brakes down different
counties. This helps people see which county was voting the most and which county might not have 
voted as much either due to not as large of a county or lack of information to vote or if they decided not
to vote. It will also help canidates see how popular they are. If they loose and it was a close call, they
might try again to be electeed, but if they did not recieve that many votes it helps the canidiate know thier 
popuularity. With this script you could modify it to see what percentage of people 
who are registered to vote are actually voting. Another way to modify this script is to
look which parties voted for the canidate. It will help people see if that canidate was favorable
between differnt parties or only one.
